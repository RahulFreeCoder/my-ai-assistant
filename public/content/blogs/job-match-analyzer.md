## 🚀 Taking My AI Portfolio Assistant to the Next Level → Introducing Job Match View

A few weeks back, I shared my work on building an AI Portfolio Assistant — a personal AI that answers questions about my career, projects, and leadership journey.

Now, I’ve taken it further with a new feature: Job Match View.

### 🔎 The Challenge:
Professionals (myself included) often ask: “Do my skills align with today’s high-demand roles? Where are the gaps?”

### 💡 The Solution:
I built a Job Match module that:

- Reads job descriptions.
- Matches them against my portfolio (skills, projects, experience). using LLMS embeddings
- Get Overall Matching score. 
- Hghlights overlaps + skill gaps in real time.

### ⚙️ Under the Hood:
Powered by **embeddings + CrewAI orchestration**, the assistant not only checks alignment but also explains why a role is a good fit (or what to improve).

### 🌍 Why It Matters:
This isn’t just personal. Imagine applying this in:

- Enterprises → Matching employees to internal roles.
- EdTech → Guiding learners on next skills to acquire.
- Career Coaches → Offering AI-driven career insights.

👉 This is the **second milestone** in my journey of blending **AI + Cloud + Banking Transformation** experience into practical solutions.

✨ Next stop: adding predictive analytics for career growth recommendations.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:
🔹 What other features would make an **AI career assistant** truly impactful?
